Typogenetics
============

In the famous book *Goedel, Escher, Bach* by D.R.Hofstadter a toy model for genetics, the typogenetic, is used as an example for self modifying systems. These tiny sources implement the rules, stated by Hofstadter, in Haskell. It could help to understand the rules and to solve the riddle in the book as well. Have fun, gimme feedback if u like.
